# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Enhancement Project

## Overview
We've transformed Tic-Tac-Toe into a more complex challenge with a 10x10 grid, elevating the game's strategic depth. The project's focus is on developing an intelligent AI to navigate this new environment. Serving both as an educational platform for AI and a showcase of adaptable AI in complex scenarios, this project brings a fresh perspective to a classic game.

## Key Features
- **Expanded Board Sizes**: Accommodates from the classic 3x3 to a challenging 10x10 grid.
- **Advanced AI Algorithms**: Implements the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for enhanced decision-making.
- **Dynamic Depth Adjustment**: Modifies the AI's search depth based on the game's progression, balancing rapid response with strategic analysis.
- **Memoization for Efficiency**: Uses memoization to improve AI performance by storing and reusing previous calculations.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with Tkinter for an engaging gameplay experience.
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: Ensures game logic is reliable and accurate.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Cd AI_Assignment**
2. **Run the game:**
   1. ***console version:***: python app.py
   2. ***Gui version:***: python gui.py
## Key Features:
**Execute unit tests to confirm the game's logic:**:python test_tictactoe.py


## Comparative Analysis
We analyze the AI's performance using metrics like nodes explored and decision time, comparing the effectiveness of the Minimax algorithm with and without depth-limited search.
